I'm Jian Wang, a 4th year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/visual-computing-and-artificial-intelligence">D6 of Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPI-INF)</a>, advised by <a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~theobalt/">Prof. Christian Theobalt</a>. I am currently working on the topic of egocentric motion capture <i class="fa-solid fa-child-reaching"></i> and am also interested in related topics including human motion generation and human performance capture. During my master's study in ISCAS, I worked in the area of programming language <i class="fa-solid fa-file-code"></i> and was fortunately supervised by <a href="https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/">Prof. Naijun Zhan</a>. I also worked with <a href="https://yichenwei.github.io/">Yichen Wei</a> and Chi Zhang on the texture generation of the 3D human body during my internship in Face++. Prior to that, I was a student working on organic materials <i class="fa-solid fa-flask-vial"></i> at Peking University. 

You can also refer to my <a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~jianwang/">personal website</a> in the group page.

<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">As I'm nearing graduation, I am actively seeking a research scientist/engineer position :)</p>
